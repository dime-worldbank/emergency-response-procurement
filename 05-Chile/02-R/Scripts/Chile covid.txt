Dear Paola,

Greetings! I'm Ruggero, a Research Analyst at DIME3, World Bank. I've been working closely with Thiago De Gouvea Scot de Arruda and Andres Gonzalez Lira, and we're delighted to welcome you aboard.

I've sent you invitations to our DropBox folder and Slack Channel; please confirm if you've received them.

While I understand you're joining part-time and catching up independently, know that I'm always available for any clarifications or discussions about our work. Whether you have questions about the project, need clarification on specific tasks, or simply wish to discuss the broader structure and objectives of our work, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best,
Ruggero
