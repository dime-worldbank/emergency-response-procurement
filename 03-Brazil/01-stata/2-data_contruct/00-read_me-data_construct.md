## 2.2: Rate of new winners
	It is also in the new data. It use the item data level.
	We don't have the data since begging, so we have to acumulate tag the new winners. It is a limition, but is not a problem.
	We can estimate the problem. For instance, since it does not win for one/two/three... years, how is probability to have never win before.

## 2.3: Market concentration (at sector level â€“ number of bidders and winners per sector)
	It still is related to winners. We can measure according the volume or number of tenders

## 2.4: Extra - process time
